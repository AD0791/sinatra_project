# Flatiron School

## Portfolio Project

This is my porfolio project as a student at flatiron school, path of software engineering.

We are going to build a full MVC application using the ruby framework sinatra. Of course we must met or satify the requirements of the program.

### Requirements

1. Build an MVC Sinatra Application.
2. Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
3. Use Multiple Models.
4. Use at least one `has_many` relationship on a User model and one `belongs_to` relationship on another model
5. Must have user accounts. The user that created a given piece of content should be the only person who can modify that content
6. Must have the abilty to create, read, update and destroy any instance of the resource that belongs to a user.
7. Ensure that any instance of the resource that belongs to a user can be edited or deleted only by that user.
8. You should also have validations for user input to ensure that bad data isn't added to the database. The fields in your signup form should be required and the user attribute that is used to login a user should be a unique value in the DB before creating the user.

### Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your Sinatra Application.
2. When you create the Sinatra app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.
3. Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. **This is important and you'll be graded on this**.
4. While you're working on it, record a 30 min coding session with your favorite screen capture tool. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit the video, but we may ask for it at a later time.
5. Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
6. Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement _before_ you submit your project.
7. [Fill out this checklist.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIrS7g6y_B4dAY7HGS4yAndg9bfHuw7GmsiwA6MQXXqNrDjA/viewform?entry.237262577&entry.835010005&entry.301147721)
8. Prepare a short video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working application.
9. Write a blog post about the project and process.
10. When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please _donâ€™t_ use the Ask New Question feature. Rather than working with Learn Experts, please reach out to your Learn Instructor responsible for this section instead
